# 🚀 Design Patterns in Java

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains implementations of various **Design Patterns** in Java, categorized into **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral** patterns. Each pattern includes code examples, UML diagrams, and explanations to help developers understand when and how to use them effectively.

## 📖 What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They help make code more maintainable, scalable, and efficient. The three main categories are:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation mechanisms.
   - Singleton
   - Factory Method
   - Abstract Factory
   - Builder
   - Prototype

2. **Structural Patterns**: Focus on class and object composition.
   - Adapter
   - Bridge
   - Composite
   - Decorator
   - Facade
   - Flyweight
   - Proxy

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on object interaction and responsibility distribution.
   - Chain of Responsibility
   - Command
   - Iterator
   - Mediator
   - Memento
   - Observer
   - State
   - Strategy
   - Template Method
   - Visitor
